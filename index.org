This repository holds ~cogs~ which is a system for generating
configuration objects based on defining abstract schema which may then
produce specific generating schema (eg, for Avro, Protobuf, etc) or
validating schema (eg JSON Schema).

More documentation can be found in the [[file:demo.org][demo write up]].
